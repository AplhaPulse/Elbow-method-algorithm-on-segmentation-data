# Elbow Method Implementation for K-Means Clustering

This repository provides an R implementation of the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering.

## Purpose:

* Determines the optimal number of clusters (k) for K-Means clustering.
* Balances minimizing within-cluster variation (WCSS) with avoiding overfitting.
* Provides a visual aid for selecting the appropriate 'k' value.

## Implementation:

* Uses R's `kmeans` function to perform K-Means clustering.
* Calculates the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for various 'k' values.
* Generates a plot of WCSS against 'k' to visualize the "elbow" point.
* Provides the WCSS values and the user-selected optimal 'k'.

## Usage:

1.  Install necessary R packages (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`).
2.  Input your dataset or generate sample data.
3.  Run the provided R script (`elbow_method.Rmd`).
4.  Visually inspect the generated plot to identify the "elbow" point.
5.  Input the optimal 'k' value as prompted by the script.
6.  Interpret output:
    * The generated plot shows the relationship between 'k' and WCSS.
    * The optimal 'k' is the point where the rate of WCSS decrease sharply changes.

## Key Concepts:

* **K-Means:** A partitioning clustering algorithm that groups data into 'k' clusters.
* **WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares):** A measure of the compactness of clusters.
* **Elbow Point:** The point on the WCSS vs. 'k' plot where the rate of decrease in WCSS significantly slows down.
* **Optimal 'k':** The number of clusters that provides a good balance between model complexity and data fit.

## Output:

* A plot of WCSS vs. 'k' (the elbow curve).
* The WCSS values for each 'k' tested.
* The optimal 'k' value, as determined by the user.
