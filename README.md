# Elbow Method Implementation for K-Means Clustering

This repository provides a Python implementation of the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering.

## Purpose

- Determines the optimal number of clusters (k) for K-Means clustering.
- Balances minimizing within-cluster variation (WCSS) with avoiding overfitting.
- Provides a visual aid for selecting the appropriate 'k' value.

## Implementation

- Uses Python's `scikit-learn` library to perform K-Means clustering.
- Calculates the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for various 'k' values.
- Generates a plot of WCSS against 'k' to visualize the "elbow" point.
- Provides the WCSS values and the user-selected optimal 'k'.

## Usage

1. Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`).
2. Input your dataset or generate sample data.
3. Run the provided Python script (`elbow_method.py`).
4. Visually inspect the generated plot to identify the "elbow" point.
5. Input the optimal 'k' value as prompted by the script.
6. Interpret output:
    - The generated plot shows the relationship between 'k' and WCSS.
    - The optimal 'k' is the point where the rate of WCSS decrease sharply changes.

## Key Concepts

- **K-Means:** A partitioning clustering algorithm that groups data into 'k' clusters.
- **WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares):** A measure of the compactness of clusters.
- **Elbow Point:** The point on the WCSS vs. 'k' plot where the rate of decrease in WCSS significantly slows down.
- **Optimal 'k':** The number of clusters that provides a good balance between model complexity and data fit.

## Output

- A plot of WCSS vs. 'k' (the elbow curve).
- The WCSS values for each 'k' tested.
- The optimal 'k' value, as determined by the user.
